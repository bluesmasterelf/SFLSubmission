Greetings,

I'm afraid I lost track of the pipfile along the way. I'm running Python 3.9, and only installed perhaps 4 or 5 dependencies. 
The bulk of meaningful code can be found in outlier_pipeline.py, 
with a Jupyter notebook and corresponding html file documenting an easier to read version of that same content.
